# Doing The First Phone Screen

Whenever I roll off a consulting contract, I look for "the next thing." The next thing may be another client engagement, 
a full time job, a speculative project or some combination of these all. Ideally, I have the next thing in hand and there's an orderly transition, 
but I've had mixed success here. Sometimes I have "holes" in my schedule, other times I have a transitional overlap of two consulting engagements.
Neither is ideal, but overlap is better than a hole.

I'm usually flexible about the working relationship with the company or client. If they want an employee and it works for me, I can be an employee. 
If they want a consultant and it works for me, I can consult. I turn my consulting
practice on or off as needed. The carrying costs during these "hibernations" isn't zero and factors into my evaluation of job offers.
There are a few differences, of course, between contracting and employment, such as who makes the employer tax contribution, if I can collect unemployment 
after a work "separation" and benefits contributions (mainly healthcare). Tax collectors add some additional constraints, such as who decides how the work 
is done. Generally, software is done largely one way: in teams, using agile techniques, with source control, unit tests and continuous integration.
So neither I nor my employer/client disagree on the means of creation. Nevertheless companies and recruiters are often confused by this fluidity, 
as if their paying federal and state governments first is magical. 
Every employers thinks employees are cheaper for them. They are in the long haul, but I'm paying attention to profit and loss also, 
namely mine. That's an entry for another day.

For programming jobs, the process is pretty prototypically. There's typically two phone screens (one with human resources then one with a technical person, 
usually online), followed by an in-person, on-site interview for most of a single day, 
followed by a job offer/consulting engagement with some ensuant negotation. Then work. 
It's probably a little different for C-level executives: more meetings (because executives love meetings) and more things to 
[negotiate](https://money.cnn.com/2002/09/06/news/companies/welch_ge/). I'm not too worried about chauffers and private jets, 
but I also admit to little experience here. Who knows? I could get used to a private jet if pressed.

I recently "phone screened" with a potential employer [Mitre](https://www.mitre.org/). It was a positive experience (since I'm naming them publicly). 
I have delayed the posting of this entry until _after_ I'm accepted or rejected. Otherwise,
I'll be forced to remove any concrete and interesting details. The specific company or specific job isn't all that relevant here, it's the preparation process that I think is worthwhile. As always, its how _I_ did it this one time. There's
all sorts of books on this (but none I've read recently). Some of its commonsense: 1) who are you talking to and what do they do? 2) 
how can you help them immediately and in the longer term, 
3) who are you (relative to the role) and what do you bring to the table. Consider this orientation for the main discussion, which is either a set of open ended questions or some very specific technical questions, or a little of both.
In the discussion below, I got a little of both.

First, I try to do a little bit of preparation beforehand. I'm trying to anticipate the question "What do you know about us?". 
I try to summarize some history, such as the company's creation myth, its financial performance,
it's senior level executives (not that it matters to workerbee positions), major industries and major competitors. 
This has an MBA "case summary" feel to it, which is fine. If the particular group has a "public footprint" -- publications, github repos, linkedin profiles and
even blogs -- I'll skim those also. Sometimes I'll find something genuinely interesting or learn something new. But I also want to send the message "I prepared to talk to you because I value preparation and your time." You know. I lie.


## A Checklist

These two lists are Mitre specific, but I would do something comparable for each company and role. I might actually create a checklist like this.

* What do you know about Mitre (The Company)?

  - Incorporated 1958Â¸ first project was Sage. (Sage started Massachusetts high tech, including my first employer Digital.)
  
  - $1.7B non-profit, several domains of interesting, including healthcare.
  
  - Several FHIR projects including Synthea and Crucible (testing).
  
  - Fun fact: first .org domain name 1985.
  
  - Based in Bedford, MA and McLean, VA.
  
  - Included in "best place to work" lists 2015, 2018
  
  - Several interesting research papers, including one on ETL using RDF
  
  
* Why Do You Want to Work at Mitre (The Company)?

  - They do interesting work in both FHIR and in other domains.
  
  - They contribute to open source as a part of their investigations.
  
  - I could get paid to do FHIR. This could be good positioning for other kinds of work.
  
  
These next two lists are reusable across most screens. Basically, historical highlights with a little color commentary, education and a few
important (to me anyways) catchphrases such as "player/coach". I try to anticipate the "why are you looking" question. As I get new questions,
I might make a mental note of them and prepare an answer. But I can also improvise (and you can also).


* Tell Us About Yourself (Your Elevator Pitch)?

  - I've written software for four decades in every imaginable programming language, platform and domain, for passion and profit.
  
  - BS in Math, CS in Computer Science
  
  - Worked myself up through the ranks at Digital Equipment Corporation early in my career (_demonstrates patience and adaptability_).
    Did graphics, AI, computer support engineering, financial technology (before fintech was a thing). Eventually managed a large
    group of approximately 40 developers (_demonstrates an upward progression_).
    
  - Worked at an internet startup that went public (and was later delisted).
  
  - Started a consulting practice, now over twenty years old. Helped start internet companies of various flavors, including one funded for $5M (that cratered).
  
  - Remain technical current through exploration and self study. Recently explored scala and clojure, brushed up on javascript (es2016 and es2017) and refined my mongodb skills.
    But I also learn what I need when I need it.
  
  - MBA candidate at Babson. Getting smarter about the intersection of good technology and _profitable_ technology (and it what timeframe).
  
  - Because I still write code, still have a hand in technology and I'm refining my business skills, I consider myself a good "player/coach".
  
  - I consider myself easy to work with, have a sense of humor and reasonable situational awareness. I program machines. I'm not a machine.
  
  - I can write and speak in public (but still get nervous when doing so).
  
* Why Are You Looking?

  - Coming off a longish consulting engagement, looking for the next thing to do.
  
  - Topics: FHIR, fintech, ML, distributed ledger, devops/kubernettes


* What Have You Read Recently?

  - The Dart Programming Language, Bracha
  
  - The Right Stuff, Tom Wolfe
  
  - Make It Stick, Peter Brown
  
  
## A Checklist for Them

Just as they are screening me, I'm screening them. Generally, I want to know who succeeds at their company and why. 
I unfortunately get a lot of truisms here, so I usually ask "scenario" questions at the tail end of the "in-person" interview. 
Usually these are along the lines of "Have you ever fired someone for cause? How did you handle it?" or 
"Are you a mentor to someone? What does that mean to you?" or for middle managers
the classic "How do you implement a decision or policy you disagree with?"

* What technical skills are you looking for? Any must haves?

* What soft skills are you looking for?

* Who succeeds at your company and why?

* What's the next job after this job?

* How is initative and creativity rewarded?

* How will this job get me where I want to go?

* How has the company grown? Any layoffs? Why?

* What's next?



## Questions Mitre Asked

* When you write software, what makes it maintainable? Me: test driven development, which makes code testable and forces me to consider edge conditions earlier; writing documentation and "doc comments" first, which again forces me to think
  through implementation strategy and finally implementing code. Good git check-ins help, although you can sometimes overthink them trying to manage the git log. I opined that behavior driven development (aka cucumber) _could_ be useful, but
  always seemed to miss the mark that it could be authored by (say) business analysts. What I missed: good and clear assumptions help, for example understand the overall architecture or approach (say three tier or a controller and a bunch of workers).
  
* What's the difference between mongodb and relational databases? Me: mongo: documents without schema, no transactions, no joins, eventually consistency (CAM), 
  horizontal scaling through sharding; relational databases: transactions, joins, normalized schema with enforcement, triggers, sql, ACID. I wasn't that artificulate.
  
* Why do you think FHIR will succeed? Me: the economic and social needs are becoming too great (healthcare is too costly and growing without stopping) 
  and the underlying technologies (web, json, mongo etc) have become robust enough that we'll progress this time,
  despite any pain, politics or hiccups.
