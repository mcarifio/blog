# Office Tour

Coronavirus has us all working from home (if working at all). With that, there's an increased interest in home office setups, computing rigs and so forth.
Since I hack my office space periodically, I've found this interesting and fun, but I guess I have ecletic interests. I come at this problem a little bit
differently -- my home office is "workshop chic" -- which has lead to a different set of decisions and results. Since a post will help me (force me) to
articulate the thought process, here it is. Like any "radically transparent" exercise, my home office might open me up to judgement, but hatah's gonna hate,
so hate away.
