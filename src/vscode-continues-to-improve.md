# Visual Studio Code Continues to Improve

Of course, I'm often late to the party, but like much of the Internet I've been tracking and experimenting with Microsoft's [Visal Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). I spent a lot of time with it's namesake [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) in the '90's and "oughts". I never viewed Microsoft as perfect, but I generally respected it's engineering including its flagship programming tool. I thought (and still think) that .Net was more than just a response to Oracle's (then Sun's) Java. C# was well-designed _and_ well executed; Microsoft was all in ... on Windows ... as usual. Like almost everyone else outside Microsoft, I've been surprised by Microsoft's authentic embrace of OSX and Linux, although publications now paint the anti-linux reversal as a [Macbook killer strategy](https://wccftech.com/microsoft-linux-a-cancer-warming-up-beat-macbooks/) and rectifying [a past mistake](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-once-called-linux-a-cancer-and-that-was-a-big-mistake/)). In 2001, when [Steve Ballmer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Ballmer), then the successor CEO to Bill Gates, made his infamous ["linux is a cancer"](http://www.suntimes.com/output/tech/cst-fin-micro01.html) remark, the software landscape was quite different. The Windows/Office franchises made a lot of money and Microsoft considered that revenue stream worth fighting for and protecting. Interesting, if you read the entire interview, I think Ballmer is essentially misquoted. He directly admits that Microsoft would have to earn its price premium through competition and -- with no hint of irony --  also asks to compete on a level playing field. He also focused on one part of GPL v2, the definition of a "derivitive work". Ballmer certainly had financial incentives to bad mouth opensource and may have been confused about how code "linking" creates a derivitive work, but he also wasn't alone then. Or now. [The Free Software Foundation](https://www.fsf.org/) believes [code linking creates a derivitive work](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0-faq.html#LinkingWithGPL) in all circumstances. [Barry Rosen](https://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6366) doesn't agree and [he has company](https://lwn.net/Articles/548216/). This "fine point" has been important enough to earn itself a name: [_the linking exception_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPL_linking_exception) and a variant GNU license, the [Lesser GNU License](). The Internet can lay down its pitchforks; Ballmers wasn't as misinformed as [they](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/06/02/ballmer_linux_is_a_cancer/) believe. You can dislike him for all sorts of reasons. But he knows how to read.

That's all politics. And history. I think [Satya Nardella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella), the current Microsoft CEO, had watched the industry vote with its feet and despite Microsoft's technical excellence in many areas, [little feat](https://youtu.be/z3LNhZ7msI4) weren't running toward Microsoft. They were going cloud, going Linux and going web. So Nardella skated to where the puck would be. Even though he loves cricket and probably hates [that Gretsky quote](https://www.canadianbusiness.com/blogs-and-comment/stop-using-gretzky-where-the-puck-is-quote/)
