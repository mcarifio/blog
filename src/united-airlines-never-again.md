# United Airlines, Never Again



We all have travel tales of woe. Lousy service, lousy meals, lousy boarding, lousy airports, missed connections, terrible service. Air travel is complicated. Margins are tight. Websites are complicated and confusing. I don’t want to bore you with yet another woeful tale, in a long line of such tales stretching to the horizon (alert, flying pun).

Luckily I don’t fly all that much. My last time was about two years ago. Even in the last two years, service has gotten worse. I recently flew United. Never, ever again. Confusing website, confused service, charged twice for the same flight and charged to make the change on top of it. Then the flight was three hours late, would have missed a connection and had to rebook and fly to a different airport. Spent 30 minutes this morning, mostly on hold, to fix the billing error and got lectured that I had actually made two reservations.

I disputed the charge with VISA.

United, you look to me like a company that’s about to fly right into the ground. Brace for impact. In the meantime, Readers, avoid United. Otherwise you’ll endure what I just endured.
