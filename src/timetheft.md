# Timetheft

As my regular readers (aka "no one") know, I'm a pretty diehard Linux user, even to preferring it as my daily desktop. I was once a daily Windows user also, from around 1988 to around 2005. I've even wasted some of my time and money on OSX, mostly to see why the koolaid kids drank the koolaid. Apple is to be admired for it's product's "production values", especially it's Retina displays and for it's skill extracting money from it's customer's wallets or purses. But I must be a philistine. I never bought the premium prices for the incremental engineering improvements. I'm quite happy to pay more money for better stuff. I just felt like I was paying more money.

But there's a different kind of price to pay when "going Linux": polish. This lack of polish shows up in wasted time (yours) and often confusion. It's not just Linux either, of course. Today I spent several hours configuring two Epson printers to scan directly to both sdcards and to Google cloud. Even though both printers were Epson, they might have come from different planets. It was pretty slick at the end, of course, to scan a document directly to a google drive without any intermediate futzing. But it took a lot of reading, googling and experimentation to get there. Apple's attention to details -- it's polish -- isn't just estetic. It actually saves time and saves money. But I still won't purchase their products. Which kinda doesn't make sense.

I'm starting notice timetheft everywhere. When my accountant, financial planner or attorney takes their time responding to a question, it delays my progress. When a software tool doesn't work as documented. When Amazon product descriptions are misleading and return policies are opaque. Every day, minutes and even hours are stolen from me by shodding design and a willingness to take my money without providing effective services in return. It isn't illegal because it's ill defined. But it's theft nonetheless.
